This is the original content of the Upgrade Time episodes 1 to 19

# Introduction
"Encounter" is a text adventure game released in 1983 by Severn Software on multiple 8bit computers of the time, including the Oric 1 and Atmos.

The program itself is quite simple, 100% written in BASIC and sold on tapes, and this repository is my attempt at improving the game:
- This **Upgrade Time Episodes** repository contains the original snapshots of the work done on the BASIC source code while I was making [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuBEOCYVlum9cOkshSXEkOxALYoe3LVXz) about it.
- The [Encounter](https://github.com/Dhebug/Encounter) repository contains the **FloppyBuilderVersion** version, which is the current state of the project, started from scratch to use C and assembler instead


If you are interested by the topic, you can read this [blog post](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=ART85) which also links to a few related videos on my youtube channel.

The reason for the split in two repositories is that Git/GitHub does not really like to mix stuff, like despite the new project being C and Assembler github keeps staring it as BASIC, just because there were these previous attempts.

So now we have to separate repositories, that should make things easier.
